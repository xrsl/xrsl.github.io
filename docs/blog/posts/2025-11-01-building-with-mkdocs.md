# Building a Personal Site with MkDocs Material

I recently set up this site using MkDocs with the Material theme. Here's why I chose this stack and how it's been working out.

## Why MkDocs?

MkDocs is a static site generator focused on documentation, but it works great for personal sites too:

- **Simple**: Just write markdown files
- **Fast**: Static sites load instantly
- **Beautiful**: Material theme looks professional out of the box
- **Feature-rich**: Search, syntax highlighting, dark mode, and more

## Setup Process

The setup was straightforward:

```bash
uv sync
uv run mkdocs serve
```

And that's it! The development server runs with live reload, making it easy to preview changes.

## What's Next

I'm planning to add more content and possibly customize the theme further. The plugin ecosystem is extensive, so there's plenty of room to grow.
