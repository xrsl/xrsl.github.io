# Hey, I'm Resul :wave:

I'm a software engineer with a PhD in Process Systems Engineering. I build tools that help people make better decisions faster.

Currently, I'm working on applying **GenAI to developer workflows** — building agentic systems that augment how we write code, manage applications, and automate tedious tasks.

- :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } **GenAI & Agentic Workflows**

  ***

  Building AI-powered tools with Claude, Gemini, and pydantic-ai.
  Prompt engineering, multi-model architectures, and structured outputs.

- :material-file-document-outline:{ .lg .middle } **TOML-First Development**

  ***

  Using TOML, CUE, and schemas as the foundation for
  configuration, data, and AI interactions.
